==data/flexibleShareAirPods.xml==
  # configures what pods to have
  # see data/flexibleShareAirPodsAll.xml for all possible pods
  # some pods are commented out, can be added back in
  # xml files used for in browser non air FlexibleShare is data/flexibleSharePods.xml (with example of all possible pods in data/flexibleSharePodsAll.xmll)


==Overall pod xml structure==
  # each view section sets up a tab view
  # can add, change, delete views the default view config in flexibleShareAirPods.xml
  # can choose to have any of the pods in a given view
  # same as esria dashboard

==FlexSpaces pods==
  # further along than the rest, runs flexspaces views in different portlets/pods
  # doclib, search, tasks (workflow), wcm, flexspaces (pod with all views in one)
  # simplesearch and search are the same functionality currently
  # files from local files pod can be dragged into doclib pod (air only)
  # files from your desktop can be dragged into doclib pod (air only)
  # files from your desktop can be pasted into doclib pod (air only)
  # (Alfresco server needs to be running, integratedsemantics.zip webscripts need to be installed,and FlexSpacesConfig.xml needs to be configured)

==Share pods==
  # Flex UI with Alfresco Share collaboration backend
  # no commenting in blog, discussions, doclib yet
  # calendar doesn't have read of info from share calendar, or add events yet (can load a us_holiday.ics, other ics) (calendar from Ely Greenfield's quietlyscheming.com)
  # the share pods are protypes
  # the default share site for thse pods can be set in pods xml: siteUrlName="s1" (this is currently not used, need to select site in selection selection dropdown at the top left of share pods
  # (Alfresco server needs to be running, integratedsemantics.zip webscripts need to be installed,and FlexSpacesConfig.xml needs to be configured)

==Charting pods==
  # from esria dashboard, uses quietlyscheming chart animations

==Pentaho pod==
  # uses code from James Ward's port of pentaho dashboard to flex
  # built version uses sample data, code that can call pentaho server is commented out

==JasperReports pod==
  # displays reports/WebappReport.jrpxml
  # uses code from JasperReports flash viewer, changed to read from file instead of server

==BlazedDS pods==
  # There are two pods that run samples from BlazeDS
  # BlazeDS pods need blazeds samples.war in your tomcat webapps dir
  # They also need the the BlazeDS sampledb/startdb.bat running before starting tomcat

==HTML pods==
  # works better in AIR since can use air html webkit control
  # in browser version uses iframe, should stick to using tile mode and don't use cascade button
  # in pod xml set url to url of web page

==Liferay pods (AIR only)== 
  # (Each can display a given portlet from a running Liferay server)
  # the url of liferay can be set with portalUrl in the pod xml
  # the url of a liferay portlet is set with the portletUrl pod xml. To get the liferay widget url for a given portlet, choose edit configuration on portlet in liferay / sharing tab / any website tab
  # Also "Look and Feel" config on the portlet in liferay in first tab, unselecting show borders will hide liferay's portlet title and border from showing in these pods
  # to run liferay in a separate tomcat at the same time as alfresco in another tomcat, I usually change in the liferay conf/server.xml all the ports 80xx to 90xx

==Local files pod (AIR only)==
  # displays a tree and list of local files
  # useful for dragging files into other pods with native air drag/drip support (such as the doclib pods in flexibleshareair)

==Google Gadget pods (AIR only) ==
  # NOTE: Something has changed where gadget urls from google gmodules.com only display as outlines currently
  # maybe it would work if you have your own gadget server
